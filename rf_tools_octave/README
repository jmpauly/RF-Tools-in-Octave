  There is documentation in man.ps, as well as online help for most
routines.

  The simulater may need to be compiled.  Execute the command

   mkoctfile abr.cc

to produce abr.oct.  There is also an m-file version abrm.m if your
octave installation doesn't support dynamically loaded modules.

You need the signal toolbox

  octave> pkg install -forge signal 

and you will need to load it each time

  octave> pkg load signal

To run the demos,

  octave> addpath demo
  octave> rf_tools_demo
